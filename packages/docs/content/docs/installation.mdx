# Installation

We recommend using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to create your project. It's fast, easy to use, and quickly integrates with React. But you can use any other build tool you prefer.

You can create a new project with the following command, and follow the prompts

```bash
npm create vite@latest -- --template react
```

If you've followed the prompts, you'll have a new project with a `package.json` file. You can then install the `@playcanvas/react` package using your preferred package manager.

### Adding the package

First you'll need to install `@playcanvas/react` using your preferred package manager.

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        npm install @playcanvas/react playcanvas
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        yarn add @playcanvas/react playcanvas
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        pnpm add @playcanvas/react playcanvas
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Once you've installed the package, you can start using it in your project. As the next step, we recommend following the [getting started guide](/docs/guide/getting-started) to create your first project.
