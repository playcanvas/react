# EnvAtlas

> [!NOTE]
>
>  The `EnvAtlas` component is deprecated. Please use the [`Environment`](./environment) component instead.

The `EnvAtlas` is used to add realistic lighting to a scene. 

Image Based Lighting (IBL) is a technique to simulate environmental lighting often using an capture of a real world environment. It can add much more natural nuanced lighting to a scene than simply by using [Lights](/api/components/light) alone.

The EnvAtlas component requires a Textures Atlas Asset. There are many sources available that provide high quality textures assets such as [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/), [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/), and [OpenFootage](https://www.openfootage.net/). You may need to convert the format to a Textures Atlas asset using this [online texture tool](https://playcanvas.com/texture-tool).

## Usage

This example will load an environment atlas asset and apply it to the scene. An `<EnvAtlas>` component can be added to any entity in the scene, but it will have affect all entities in the scene.

```jsx copy filename="env-atlas.jsx"
import { EnvAtlas } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { useEnvAtlas } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

// Load the environment atlas asset
export const EnvAtlasExample = () => {
  const { asset } = useEnvAtlas('/env_atlas_1k.png')

  if (!asset) return null

  return <Entity>
    <EnvAtlas asset={asset} />
    <Entity>
      <Render type="box" />
    </Entity>
  </Entity>
}
```

## Props

The following props are based on the [EnvAtlas Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/EnvAtlasComponent.html) from PlayCanvas version **<PcVersion />**. This documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript types of the installed PlayCanvas package.
