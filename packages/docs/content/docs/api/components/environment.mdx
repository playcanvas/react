# Environment

The `Environment` component is used to configure the environment lighting and skybox for a scene. It provides a comprehensive way to set up atmospheric lighting, skyboxes, and environmental effects that affect the entire scene.

## Overview

The Environment component combines several PlayCanvas scene and sky properties into a single, easy-to-use component:

- **Skybox**: Sets the background texture for the scene
- **Environment Atlas**: Provides Image-Based Lighting (IBL) for realistic environmental reflections
- **Sky Settings**: Controls sky dome properties, rotation, scale, and positioning
- **Scene Settings**: Manages exposure, luminance, and other global lighting parameters

## Usage

The Environment component should be placed within an `<Application>` component. Only one Environment component should be used per application instance.

### Basic Usage

```jsx copy filename="environment-basic.jsx"
import { Environment } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { useAsset } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const EnvironmentExample = () => {
  const skyboxAsset = useAsset('/skybox.jpg')
  const envAtlasAsset = useAsset('/env_atlas.png')

  return (
    <Application>
      <Environment 
        skybox={skyboxAsset}
        envAtlas={envAtlasAsset}
        exposure={1.2}
      />
      {/* Your scene entities here */}
    </Application>
  )
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```jsx copy filename="environment-advanced.jsx"
import { Environment } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { useAsset } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const AdvancedEnvironmentExample = () => {
  const skyboxAsset = useAsset('/skybox.jpg')
  const envAtlasAsset = useAsset('/env_atlas.png')

  return (
    <Application>
      <Environment 
        envAtlas={envAtlasAsset}
        skybox={skyboxAsset}
        
        // Environment lighting
        exposure={1.1}
        
        // Sky dome settings
        scale={[200, 200, 200]}
        position={[0, 50, 0]}
        center={[0, 0.05, 0]}
        rotation={[0, 45, 0]}
        type="dome"
        depthWrite={true}
      />
    </Application>
  )
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Single Instance**: Only one `<Environment/>` component should be used per application instance. Multiple instances will cause warnings and only the first will be used.
- **Asset Requirements**: The `skybox` and `envAtlas` props expect PlayCanvas Asset instances, typically loaded using the `useAsset` hook.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: The component automatically restores default values when unmounted.

## Props

The following props are based on PlayCanvas version **<PcVersion />**. This documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript types of the installed PlayCanvas package.
