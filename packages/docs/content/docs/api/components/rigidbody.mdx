# Rigidbody

The `Rigidbody` component enables physics for an [`Entity`](/docs/api/entity), allowing it to interact with the global physics simulation. You can apply forces, torques, and other physics behaviours to an entity with a `Rigidbody` component and it will respond accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Run `npm i sync-ammo` and use `<Application usePhysics/>` to enable physics.

You can learn more about how physics work in PlayCanvas in the [Physics docs](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/physics/).

## Usage

```jsx copy filename="rigidbody.jsx"
import { Rigidbody } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

const RigidbodyExample = () => {
  return <Entity>
    <Rigidbody type="dynamic" mass={12} />
    <Render type="box" />
  </Entity>
}
```

## Props

The following props are based on the [RigidBody Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RenderComponent.html) from PlayCanvas version **<PcVersion />**. This documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript types of the installed PlayCanvas package.

<TSDoc
  code={`import type { RigidBody } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
type $ = React.ComponentProps<typeof RigidBody>
export default $`}
/>
