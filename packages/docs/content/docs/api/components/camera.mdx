# Camera

In order to view a scene, you need a camera. The `Camera` component enables an [Entity](/docs/api/entity) to render a scene. You can use the entity's position and rotation to control the camera.

## Usage

A `Camera` is a component, so you attach it to an `Entity` and the camera will render the scene from the entity's position and rotation.

```jsx copy filename="camera.jsx"
import { Camera } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

const CameraExample = () => {
    return <Entity>
        <Camera fov={28} clearColor="rebeccapurple" />
    </Entity>
}
```

Learn more about the [Camera Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CameraComponent.html) in the PlayCanvas documentation.
