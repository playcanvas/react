import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="️💡">
  Enable physics by installing `npm i sync-ammo` and enabling physics on the Application using`<Application usePhysics/>`.
</Callout>

The `Collision` component attaches a PlayCanvas [Collision Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CollisionComponent.html) to an [`Entity`](/docs/api/entity).

It allows an [`Entity`](/docs/api/entity) to participate in collision detection with other entities that have collision components. This is useful for physics simulations, trigger zones, and other gameplay mechanics that require detecting when objects intersect.

Learn more about Collision components in the [PlayCanvas documentation](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CollisionComponent.html). Also see the [Rigidbody](/api/components/rigidbody) component for more information on how to use collision components with physics.

## Usage

You attach a Collision component to an Entity in the same way you would attach a Render component. To work with physics, you should also attach a `Rigidbody` component to the same `Entity`, and probably a `Render` component too.

```jsx copy filename="collision.jsx"
import { Collision, Rigidbody } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

const CollisionExample = () => {
    return <Entity>
        <Collision type="box" />
        <RigidBody type="dynamic" mass={12} />
    <Render type="box" />
</Entity>
}
```

## Props

The following props are based on the [Collision API](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/api/pc.CollisionComponent.html) from PlayCanvas version **<PcVersion />**. This documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript types of the installed PlayCanvas package.

<TSDoc
  code={`import type { Collision } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
type $ = React.ComponentProps<typeof Collision>
export default $`}
/>
