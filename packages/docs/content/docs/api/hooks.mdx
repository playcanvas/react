# Hooks

The are a a couple of hooks that are useful when working with `@playcanvas/react`. These can often be useful when creating custom components, hooks or utilities.

## `useApp`

The `useApp` hook returns the [`Application`](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.Application.html) instance that is currently active. This is useful if you need reference to the PlayCanvas Application instance directly.

```jsx
import { useApp } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'
```

## `useParent`

The `useParent` hook returns the parent `Entity` of the current component. This can be useful if you need to access the parent entity of a component. For example, if you are creating a custom component that should be attached to a specific entity.

```jsx
import { useParent } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const ChildEntity = () => {
    const parent = useParent();
    console.log(parent);

    return <Entity>
      <Render type="box" />
    </Entity>
};

const ParentEntity = () => {
  return <ChildEntity />;
};
```

## `useFrame`

The `useFrame` hook ties into the event loop and will be called on every frame whilst the component is mounted. Use this when you need to update a value or perform a calculation on every frame. This is better for performance than using react state updates.

```jsx
import { useFrame } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const entityRef = useRef(null);

  useFrame((dt) => {
    entityRef.current.rotate(0, dt, 0);
  })

  return <Entity ref={entityRef}>>
}
```
