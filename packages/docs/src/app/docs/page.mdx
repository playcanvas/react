# `@playcanvas/react`

A react library for for creating 3D apps, with an extensible Entity-Component System supporting physics, interaction, and scripting.

import { Tabs, Code } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['Demo', 'Code']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <div className='w-full aspect-video rounded-xl overflow-hidden'>
      <ReactQueryProvider>
        <Application className='hover:cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing w-full' fillMode="NONE" resolutionMode="AUTO">
          <Example />
        </Application>
      </ReactQueryProvider>
    </div>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <Code data-language="jsx">{'sdf'}</Code>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Terminal />}
    title="Open in Playground"
    href="/playground/model-viewer"
    arrow
  />
  <OpenHomePageExampleInCodeSandbox />
</Cards>



## How does it work?

The library provides a thin declarative layer around the PlayCanvas ECS. You create an `Application` and add `Entities` to it. Entities have position, rotation and scale. You add behaviour by attaching `Components` to entities.

Here's a simple example rendering a simple 3D asset with orbit controls.

```jsx copy
import { Application, Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'
import { Camera } from "@playcanvas/react/components"
import { OrbitControls } from "@playcanvas/react/scripts"

const App = (car) => {
  return (
    <Application>
        <Entity position={[0, 2, 0]}>
          <Camera clearColor="blue"/>
          <OrbitControls />
        </Entity>
        <Entity >
          <Container asset={car} />
        </Entity>
    </Application>
  );
}
```

## Features

PlayCanvas comes with a number of built in components and scripts that you can use. This makes it easy to get started building your app.

- **Physics** - Add rigid body components to your entities to enable physics sims
- **Gaussian Splats** - Add a `GSplat` component to render high quality 3D content
- **Interactivity** - Supports PointerEvents with event bubbling
- **Scripts** - Provides an imperative API for adding non-declaratives logic to your app
- **Built using a natural ECS architecture.**
- **Asset System** - Easy to use asset loader for 3D models, audio, video and other assets
- **ECS** - Intuitive Entity Component System

## Who's using it?

The library is currently beng use in product at SnapChat for 

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<Icons.snapchat />}
    title="SnapChat"
    href="https://ml.snapchat.com"
    arrow
  />
</Cards>

## First steps

If you're familiar with React but new to PlayCanvas and 3D in general, the best place to start is the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started). It will walk you through creating a simple app and explain the core concepts.

If you're already using PlayCanvas, but new to React, it's worth checking out the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn) first, which provide a great introduction to the React ecosystem. From then you can jump into the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference).

You can learn more about PlayCanvas on the [developer site](https://developer.playcanvas.com/) and through the [tutorials](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/). Similarly the React docs has a [great tutorial section](https://react.dev/learn)
