# Application

The `Application` is the root component for any PlayCanvas React application. It initializes and manages the canvas and PlayCanvas application instance.

## Usage

The `Application` component wraps all other components.

```jsx copy
import { Application, Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'
import { Camera } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { OrbitControls } from '@playcanvas/react/scripts'

export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <Application 
      fillMode={FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW}
      resolutionMode={RESOLUTION_AUTO}
    >
      <Entity name="camera" position={[0, 0, 10]}>
        <Camera />
        <OrbitControls />
      </Entity>
      {/* Your scene content */}
    </Application>
  )
}
```

## Props

<TSDoc
  code={`
  import { Application } from '@playcanvas/react'
  type $ = React.ComponentProps<typeof Application>;
  export default $;
  `}
/>

### `usePhysics`
Enables physics for the application. Learn more about [Physics in Playcanvas](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/physics/). Entities will need to have a `RigidBody` and `Collisions` components to be affected by physics.

Type: `boolean`
Default: `false`

### `fillMode`
This prop determines how the canvas fills its container. It accepts one of the following values from PlayCanvas:

- `FILLMODE_NONE` - The canvas will be the size specified by the `width` and `height` props
- `FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW` - The canvas will fill the browser window
- `FILLMODE_KEEP_ASPECT` - The canvas will maintain its aspect ratio while filling the container

Default: `FILLMODE_NONE`

### `resolutionMode`
The `resolutionMode` prop determines how the canvas resolution is set. It accepts one of the following values from PlayCanvas:

- `RESOLUTION_AUTO` - The resolution will be automatically adjusted based on the device's pixel ratio
- `RESOLUTION_FIXED` - The resolution will be fixed at the specified width and height
- `RESOLUTION_NATIVE` - The resolution will match the device's native resolution

Default: `RESOLUTION_AUTO`

### `width`
The `width` prop specifies the width of the canvas when using `RESOLUTION_FIXED`.

### `height`
The `height` prop specifies the height of the canvas when using `RESOLUTION_FIXED`.
