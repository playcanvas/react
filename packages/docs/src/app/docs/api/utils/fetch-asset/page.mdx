# Fetch Asset

`fetchAsset` is a simple function that loads an asset from a url and returns a corresponding `Asset`. It returns a promise that resolves when the asset loads meaning you can use it with libraries such as `SWR` or `react-query` which suspend whilst the asset loads.

We recommend reading more about assets in the [Loading Assets](/docs/guide/loading-assets) guide.

## Usage

If you just want a simple loading hook, you can simply wrap `fetchAsset` in a custom hook.

```jsx
import { fetchAsset } from '@playcanvas/react/utils'

const useAsset = (src, type) => {
    const app = useApp()
    const [asset, setAsset] = useState(null)

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchAsset(app, src, type).then(setAsset)
    }, [src])

    return asset
}

const Container = (( src )) => {

    const model = useAsset(src, 'container')
    if(!model) return null

    return (<Entity {...props}>
        <Render asset={model} />
    </Entity>)
}
```
