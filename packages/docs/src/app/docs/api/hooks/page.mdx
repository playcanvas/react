# Hooks

The are a a couple of hooks that are useful when working with `@playcanvas/react`. These can often be useful when creating custom components, hooks or utilities.

## `useApp`

The `useApp` hook returns the [`Application`](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.Application.html) instance that is currently active. This is useful if you need reference to the PlayCanvas Application instance directly.

```jsx
import { useApp } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'
```

## `useParent`

The `useParent` hook returns the parent `Entity` of the current component. This can be useful if you need to access the parent entity of a component. For example, if you are creating a custom component that should be attached to a specific entity.

```jsx
import { useParent } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'
```

## `useMaterial`

The `useMaterial` hook returns a [`StandardMaterial`](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.StandardMaterial.html) instance. This is useful if you need to create materials and apply them to `Render` components.
```jsx
import { useMaterial } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'
```
