# Entity

The `Entity` component is the fundamental building block in PlayCanvas React applications. It represents a node in the scene graph hierarchy and can contain other entities as children, as well as components that define its behavior and appearance.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'

export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <Entity >
      <Entity name="child" />
      <Entity name="other-child" >
        <Entity name="nested-child" >
      </Entity>
    </Entity>
  )
}
```

Entities on their own are not visible, they need components to have behaviour. You can add components to an entity by nesting them within the `Entity` component.

## Props

### `name`
The `name` prop sets the name of the entity in the scene graph. This is useful for debugging and finding entities at runtime.

Type: `string`

### `position`
The `position` prop sets the local position of the entity relative to its parent.

Type: `[number, number, number]` (x, y, z coordinates)

### `rotation` 
The `rotation` prop sets the local rotation of the entity in euler angles (degrees).

Type: `[number, number, number]` (x, y, z rotation)

### `scale`
The `scale` prop sets the local scale of the entity.

Type: `[number, number, number]` or `number` (uniform scale)

### `enabled`
The `enabled` prop determines if the entity and its children are enabled/visible.

Type: `boolean`
Default: `true`
