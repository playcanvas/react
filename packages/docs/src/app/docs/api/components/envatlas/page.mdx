# EnvAtlas

The `EnvAtlas` is used to add realtistic lighting to a scene. 

Image Based Lighting (IBL) is a technique to simulate environmental lighting often using an capture of a real world environment. It can add much more natural nuanced lighting to a scene than simply by using [Lights](/api/components/light) alone.

The EnvAtlas component requires a Textures Atlas Asset. There are many sources available that provide high quality textures assets such as [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/), [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/), and [OpenFootage](https://www.openfootage.net/). You may need to convert the format to a Textures Atlas asset using this [online texture tool](https://playcanvas.com/texture-tool).

## Usage

This example will load an environment atlas asset and apply it to the scene. An `<EnvAtlas>` component can be added to any entity in the scene, but it will have affect all entities in the scene.

```jsx
import { EnvAtlas } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

// Load the environment atlas asset
const { data : envAtlas } = useEnvAtlas('/env_atlas_1k.png')

<Entity>
    <EnvAtlas asset={envAtlas} />
    <Entity>
        <Render type="box" />
    </Entity>
</Entity>
}
```
