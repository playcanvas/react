# Light

The `Light` component attaches a [Light Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.LightComponent.html) to an [`Entity`](/docs/api/entity). You can position the light source by transforming the parent entity. A light can be directional, omnni, or spot. Each type has different properties and behaviors.

You can add multiple lights to a scene to create a realistic lighting environment.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Light } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

const DirectionalLight = (props) => {
    return <Entity>
        <Light type="directional" {...props} />
    </Entity>
}
```

## Props

The following props are based on PlayCanvas version **<PcVersion />**. This documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript types of the installed PlayCanvas package.
