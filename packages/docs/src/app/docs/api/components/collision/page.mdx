# Collision

The `Collision` component attaches a PlayCanvas [Collision Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CollisionComponent.html) to an [`Entity`](/api/entity).

It allows an [`Entity`](/api/entity) to participate in collision detection with other entities that have collision components. This is useful for physics simulations, trigger zones, and other gameplay mechanics that require detecting when objects intersect.

Learn more about Collision components in the [PlayCanvas documentation](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CollisionComponent.html). Also see the [Rigidbody](/api/components/rigidbody) component for more information on how to use collision components with physics.

## Usage

You attach a Collision component to an Entity in the same way you would attach a Render component. To work with physics, you should also attach a `Rigidbody` component to the same `Entity`, and probably a `Render` component too.

```jsx copy
import { Collision, Rigidbody } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

<Entity>
    <Collision type="box" />
    <RigidBody type="dynamic" mass={12} />
    <Render type="box" />
</Entity>
}
```

## Props

### type
The type of collision shape to attach to the Entity.

Type: `"box" | "sphere" | "capsule" | "mesh" | "compound" | "cone" | "cylinder"`
Default: `"box"`

### asset
The asset to use for the collision shape.

Type: [`Asset`](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.Asset.html)

### Additional Props

Any additional props will be passed to the CollisionComponent class directly. See the [documentation](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CollisionComponent.html) for more information.
