The `Rigidbody` component enables physics for an [`Entity`](/api/entity), allowing it to interact with the global physics simulation. You can apply forces, torques, and other physics behaviours to an entity with a `Rigidbody` component and it will respond accordingly.

You can learn more about how physics work in PlayCanvas in the [Physics docs](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/physics/).

## Usage

```jsx
import { Rigidbody } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

<Entity>
    <Rigidbody type="dynamic" mass={12} />
    <Render type="box" />
</Entity>
}
```

## Props

### type
The type of rigidbody to attach to the Entity.

Type: `"dynamic" | "kinematic" | "static"`
Default: `"dynamic"`

### mass
The mass of the rigidbody.

Type: `number`
Default: `1`

### Additional Props

Any additional props will be passed to the PlayCanvas Rigidbody class directly. See the [PlayCanvas documentation](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.RigidBodyComponent.html) for more information.
