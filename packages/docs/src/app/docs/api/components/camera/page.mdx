# Camera

In order to view a scene, you need a camera. The `Camera` component enables an [Entity](/docs/api/entity) to render a scene. You can use the entity's position and rotation to control the camera.

A scene can have multiple cameras, for example to render from different points of view.

## Usage

A `Camera` is a component, so you attach it to an `Entity` and the camera will render the scene from the entity's position and rotation.

```jsx copy
import { Camera } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

<Entity>
    <Camera fov={28} clearColor="rebeccapurple" />
</Entity>
```
