# Camera

In order to view a scene, you need a camera. The `Camera` component enables an [Entity](/api/entity) to render a scene. You can use the entity's position and rotation to control the camera.

A scene can have multiple cameras, for example to render from different points of view.

## Usage

A `Camera` is a component, so you attach it to an `Entity` in the same way you would attach a `Render` component.

```jsx copy
import { Camera } from '@playcanvas/react/components'

<Entity>
    <Camera fov={28} clearColor="rebeccapurple" />
</Entity>
```

Learn more about the [Camera Component](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CameraComponent.html) in the PlayCanvas documentation.


### `type`
The `type` prop determines the type of camera. It accepts one of the following values from PlayCanvas:

- `PERSPECTIVE` - The camera will use a perspective projection
- `ORTHOGRAPHIC` - The camera will use an orthographic projection

Default: `PERSPECTIVE`

### `fov`
The `fov` prop determines the field of view of the camera. This is the angle between the camera's forward direction and the top/bottom of the screen.

Type: `number`
Default: `60`

### `near`
The `near` prop determines the near clipping plane of the camera. This is the distance from the camera to the near clipping plane.

Type: `number`
Default: `0.1`

### `far`
The `far` prop determines the far clipping plane of the camera. This is the distance from the camera to the far clipping plane.

Type: `number`
Default: `1000`

### aspectRatio
The `aspectRatio` prop determines the aspect ratio of the camera. This is the ratio of the width to the height of the screen.

Type: `number`
Default: `16 / 9`


### Additional Props

Any additional props will be passed to the PlayCanvas `CameraComponent` class directly. See the [docs](https://api.playcanvas.com/classes/Engine.CameraComponent.html) for more information.
