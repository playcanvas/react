# Working with Assets

Assets are a big part of any 3D application, and they can also take a significant amount time to load, which can make your app feel sluggish. Knowing how to load and manage assets efficiently is key to a smooth user experience.

`@playcanvas/react` provides a simple and flexible way to load assets that integrates with the rest of the React ecosystem.

```jsx copy
import { fetchAsset } from '@playcanvas/react/utils'

const asset = await fetchAsset(app, 'dino.glb', 'container')
```

The `fetchAsset` function loads and returns assets. It takes an `Application` instance and the URL and type of the asset to load. This does nothing more than asynchronously load the asset, which can be used in the `<Render>` component.

## useAsset

This can easily be wrapped in a React hook to use in a component.

```jsx copy
import { fetchAsset } from '@playcanvas/react/utils'

const useAsset = (url, type) => {
    const app = useApp()
    const [asset, setAsset] = useState(null)
    useEffect(() => {
        fetchAsset(app, url, type).then(setAsset)
    }, [app, url, type])
    return asset
}
```

## SWR/React Query

`fetchAsset` easily integrates with other data fetching libraries like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). They provide a more robust and flexible way to manage assets with caching, error handling, and more.

```jsx copy
import { useSwr } from 'swr';

const useAsset = (url, type) => {
    const app = useApp()
    return useSwr(url, (url) => fetchAsset(app, url, type))
}
```

You can find an implementation of a `react-query` hook [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/react/blob/master/examples/src/utils/hooks.js).

## Preloading

Assets can be huge and can take up significant chunk of your download. Rather than block rendering, it's generally a good idea to display something while the page is loading. It helps users know the app isn't frozen and keeps them engaged.

React provides a [`Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#suspense) component that works perfectly for this. Used in conjuction with [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [`react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), it blocks rendering a component until it's ready, displaying instead a fallback UI whilst loading.


```jsx copy filename="spinning-cube.js"
// Spins an entity
class Spinner extends Script {
    update(dt) {
        this.entity.rotateLocal(0, 10 * dt, 0);
    }
}

export default SpinningCubePreloader = (props) => {
    return (
        <Entity {...props}>
            <Script type={Spinner}/>
            <Render type='box'/>
        </Entity>
    )
}
```

```jsx copy filename="dino.js"
import SpinningCubePreloader from './spinning-cube'

const Dino = (props) => {
    const { asset } = useAsset('dino.glb')
    return <Entity {...props}>
        <Render type='asset' asset={asset}/>
    </Entity>
}


export const DinoWithPreloader = () => {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<SpinningCubePreloader/>}>
            <Dino/>
        </Suspense>
    )
}
```

Now when rendering the `DinoWithPreloader` component, the `SpinningCubePreloader` will be displayed while the `Dino` is loading. As soon as the `dino.glb` asset is ready, the `Dino` will be displayed instead.
