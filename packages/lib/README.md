## @playcanvas/react
_‚ö° A full-featured library for interactive 3D in React._

@playcanvas/react is a thin wrapper around PlayCanvas - a batteries included library for building interactive 3D content in React. Designed to get you up and running fast.

## Why PlayCanvas React?

**@playcanvas/react is designed to get you building fast** ‚Äî without the usual mess of wiring together separate libraries for physics, input or asset management. It's a complete, batteries-included toolkit for interactive 3D experiences in React.

It's built around PlayCanvas - a battle-tested, real-time 3D engine and ships with powerful built-in features out of the box.

## Getting Started

‚ö° Start building in minutes with our [Getting Started guide](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/playcanvas-react/getting-started).

### Quick Start

Create a new @playcanvas/react project and follow the instructions:

```bash
npx create playcanvas@latest -t react-t
```

### Manual Installation

Or install in an existing project with your favorite package manager:

**npm**
```bash
npm install @playcanvas/react
```

### Show me the code

Here's how you render a sphere. 

```jsx
import { Application, Entity } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { Camera, Render } from '@playcanvas/react/components';
import { OrbitControls } from '@playcanvas/react/scripts';

export function AssetViewer() {
  return (
    <Application>
      <Entity position={[0, 2, 0]}>
        <Camera />
        <OrbitControls />
      </Entity>
      <Render type="sphere"/>
    </Application>
  );
};
```

Et voil√†! ‚ú®

## Who‚Äôs building with @playcanvas/react?

Developers and studios are already using @playcanvas/react in production

- ‚ö° Snap AI uses @playcanvas/react to build real-time 3D interfaces inside their next-gen tools.
- ‚ú® Your project here? [Submit a PR](https://github.com/playcanvas/react/compare) and we‚Äôll feature it below.

## AI Ready

Every component comes with MDC rules for autocompletion, documentation, and AI integration ‚Äî ready for use in tools like Cursor or Windsurf.

### Install AI Rules for @playcanvas/react

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules && curl -s https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/playcanvas-react/rules -o .cursor/rules/playcanvas-react.mdc
```

### Install AI Rules for Blocks

To install rules for PlayCanvas Blocks:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/playcanvas-react/r/blocks.json
```

This installs the rules for the registry and for @playcanvas/react and adds them to your project.

[Grab the rules manually here](https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/playcanvas-react/rules) if you prefer.

## Contributing

If you want to build the repo from scratch, check out the following. The monorepo is split into 3 main packages:

- [@playcanvas/react](/packages/lib) - This contains the main react library
- [@playcanvas/blocks](/packages/blocks) - High level React components for common 3D use cases
- [@playcanvas/docs](/packages/docs) - The Documentation site.

If you want to run this entire project locally, including docs just `npm install` and `npm run dev` from the root of the monorepo. This will install and build all the local dependencies and run a local webserver of the docs. 

You can make changes to either the react or blocks lib and build them locally by doing `npm run build:lib` or `npm run build:blocks` respectively.

All contributions are welcome :heart:
